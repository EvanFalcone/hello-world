# hello-world

Hey friends! Welcome to my Github intro blurb .md:

My name is Evan Falcone, I am a junior developer with
experience in object-oriented programming (Java), relational
database programming (SQL) and vectorized languages (R, Matlab,
Octave).

I've since completed the Coursera Stanford Machine Learning
course as well as three courses in the John Hopkins Data
Science Specialization.

Although my programming experience has mostly revolved around
data-oriented endeavors, I am keen on investigating all facets
of programming for self-enrichment and the sheer love of learning!

Most of my work cannot be published here on Github due to
confidentiality contracts with my employers, but feel free to get
in touch if you want to see any code bits I'm able to share.

Best,
Evan
